# Reference model for *Collective Self-Consumption*

change..

## Context/ Whereas

(1)     It was identified that it is advantageous for data sharing and the eligible party working with that data, that metering and consumption data series refer to the metering point identifier and be independent from the underlying physical metering equipment. That means, that if the underlying physical metering equipment is changed, the metering point identifier doesn’t change.

(2)     For the purpose of this act, 'accounting point master data' shall refer to [TODO].

## Definitions

In this section, each term is defined:

* 'term1', in the context of this act, means ...

## Responsibilities of Market Roles

In this section the responsibilities of each market role should be described.

### Responsibilities of energy community operators

1. Metering point administrators shall make metering point master data available online to final customers and eligible parties, without undue delay and whenever the final customer needs to access or share the data.
2. Metering point administrators shall ensure that final customers can access and make available to eligible parties their validated metered data and receive it in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable format.

### Responsibitilies of metering point administrators

1. Metered data administrators shall ensure the equal treatment of all eligible parties.

## Annex

Table I contains information needed by eligible parties to set up for utilising connection point master data access in a Member State. It is primarily describing information that needs to be accessible for them to register, onboard or establish prerequisite infrastructure to take part in the procedures listed in Table III.
